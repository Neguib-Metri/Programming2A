#// Excercise Number 1; Create a program that uses random number generator to simulate flipping a coin several times. The simulated coin should be fair, meaning that the probability of heads is equal to the probability of tails. Your program should flip simulated coins until either 3 consecutive heads of 3 consecutive tails occur. Display an H each time the outcome is heads, and a T each time the outcome is tails, with all of the outcomes shown on the same line. Then display the number of flips needed to reach 3 consecutive flips with the same outcome. When your program is run it should perform the simulation 10 times and report the average number of flips needed.//
